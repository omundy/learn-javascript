## What is Javascript?

Javascript is the programming language of the web. With Javascript you can

- change HTML, CSS, or content of a web page
- respond to user events, animate or display content or media
- (using Node.js) run on a server, query to databases, publish mobile apps
- and much more.

**Programming**, the act of ‚Äúwriting instructions for a computer to execute,‚Äù usually involves:

- **Flow** - The order in which statements are executed.
- **State** - The status of data (variables) in your program.
- **Logic** - Making decisions based on conditions (state).
- **Events** - Things that happen, like user input, that may change the state.

## How to use Javascript

Javascript can run in any web browser (or on your computer using Node). The next lesson covers how to add scripts to a web page, but first let's look at two quick ways to **test** Javascript.





---


üëâ **Try it out** - Two places to test Javascript - 1

The **browser console** is an excellent tool for checking messages and warnings, as well as allowing you to test code.

1. Open DevTools and paste the below into the console at the bottom `>`. You will see a simple HTML alert.

```js
alert("hello world!");
```
**Code playgrounds** like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net" target="_blank">jsfiddle.net</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">codepen.io</a> make it easy to quickly test and share Javascript (and HTML and CSS files) in a "web environment".

üëâ **Try it out** - Two places to test Javascript - 2

2. Add the code above to one of these playgrounds to test it out.

![code playground](../../assets/img/code-playground-jsfiddle.png)

Some examples from class:

- codepen.io <a href="https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/PomvjqW" target="_blank">Random Article Generator</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/OJRWQoY" target="_blank">Javascript / jQuery Cat Image Swapper</a>
- jsfiddle.net <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ow3n/sw6ek1wb/" target="_blank">Choropleth map with Mapbox</a>






---


## Data Types

- Javascript is a "loosely-typed" language.
- It will infer the type of data you store in a variable (unlike other languages).

![true](../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-data-types.png)

<div class="caption slides-small">Javascript organizes data by primitive and non-primitive types</div>

---

## Data Types

- All programming languages use data to manage their state.
- Data has both a **value** and a **type**.
- Below, the **`boolean`** *type* can only have one of two *values*: `true` or `false`.

```js
true
false
```



The Javascript **`number`** type does not distinguish integer from float values.
```js
1
3.14
-491143422
```



---


The **`string`** type includes any character as its value, wrapped using a single `'words'` or double `"other words"` quotes. The number `3.14` below is technically a string because it is wrapped in quotes.
```js
"hello world ü•∞"
'3.14'
`strings wrapped
 using back ticks support
 multiple lines`
```

A later lesson will discuss types categorized as `Objects` (collections like `arrays`, `objects`, `Date`, etc.).
```js
[4,1,2]
{key: "value"}
new Date()
```

## Expressions

An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators" target="_blank">expression</a> is any unit of code that resolves to a data value. Expressions are the fundamental building blocks of code, and use data ("operands") with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp" target="_blank">operators</a> to perform math, logic, or string calculations.



---


### üëâ **Try it out** - Explore data types using the Javascript Console

1. **Primary expressions** - If you pass data to Javascript it will simply **return** the data's value.

```js
12
```

2. Adding an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators" target="_blank">arithmetic</a> operator and another data value will prompt Javascript to **evaluate** the code, multiplying the values to **return** (*output*) the *new* value `144` produced.

```js
12 * 12
```




---


3. If you use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof" target="_blank">typeof</a> operator, Javascript will return a string describing the data's *type*.

```js
typeof 12
```

4. The following <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators" target="_blank">comparison operators</a> will return a logical `boolean` value based on whether the comparison in the expression is true.

```js
4 > 5
```

The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality" target="_blank">equality operator</a> `==` checks to see if two values are equal, `true`

```js
1 == 1
```



---


The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Inequality" target="_blank">inequality operator</a> `!=` checks whether its two operands are *not equal*.

```js
1 != 1
```




The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality" target="_blank">strict equality operator</a> `===` will compare the value **and type**, and is specific to Javascript. **What will these return?**

```js
1 === "1"
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

It will return `false` because `1` is a `number` and `"1"` is a `string`.

</details>

---


If you combine expressions, Javascript will evaluate each in the appropriate order. **What will these return?**

```js
typeof (4 > 5)
typeof (typeof (4 > 5))
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
typeof (4 > 5) // -> "boolean"
typeof (typeof (4 > 5)) // -> "string"
```

`4 > 5` uses a comparison operator so it will return `false`. But since `typeof` returns a string, the first line will return `"boolean"` (note the double quotes), and the second line will return `"string"`

</details>








---


## Statements

- A **statement** is an instruction that performs a specific action.
- Like a sentence‚Äîstatements have punctuation (a semicolon `;`) to note when the instruction is complete.
- This statement assigns a value to the `greeting` variable with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators" target="_blank">assignment operator</a>.
