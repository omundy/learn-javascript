## What is Javascript?

Javascript is the programming language of the web. With Javascript you can

- change HTML, CSS, or content of a web page
- respond to user events, animate or display content or media
- (using Node.js) run on a server, query to databases, publish mobile apps
- and much more.


**Programming**, the act of ‚Äúwriting instructions for a computer to execute,‚Äù usually involves:

- **Flow** - The order in which statements are executed.
- **State** - The status of data (variables) in your program.
- **Logic** - Making decisions based on conditions (state).
- **Events** - Things that happen, like user input, that may change the state.

Note the logic (decisions the computer makes) based on state (the status of variables in the program) and events (e.g. user input) directing the computer towards its goal.</sup>





## How to use Javascript

Javascript can run in any web browser or on your computer (using Node). The [next lesson](../../README.md#javascript-part1) covers how to add scripts to a web page, but first let's look at two quick ways to **test** Javascript.

üëâ **Try it out** - Two places to test Javascript.

The **browser console** is an excellent tool for checking messages and warnings, as well as allowing you to test code.

1. Open DevTools and paste the below into the console at the bottom `>`. You will see a simple HTML alert.

```js
alert("hello world!");
```
**Code playgrounds** like [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net) and [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) make it easy to quickly test and share Javascript (and HTML and CSS files) in a "web environment".

2. Add the code above to one of these playgrounds to test it out.

![code playground](../../assets/img/code-playground-jsfiddle.png)

Some examples from class:

- codepen.io [Random Article Generator](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/PomvjqW)
- codepen.io [Javascript / jQuery Cat Image Swapper](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/OJRWQoY)
- jsfiddle.net [Choropleth map with Mapbox](https://jsfiddle.net/ow3n/sw6ek1wb/)




## Data Types

All programming languages use data to manage their state. Data has both a **value** and a **type**. Below, the **`boolean`** *type* can only have one of two *values*: `true` or `false`.

```js
true
false
```

Javascript is a loosely-typed language. This means Javascript will infer the data type of variables so you don't have to. Javascript organizes data by primitive and non-primitive types:

![true](../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-data-types.png)

The Javascript **`number`** type does not distinguish integer from float values.
```js
1
3.14
-491143422
```

The **`string`** type includes any character as its value, wrapped using a single `'words'` or double `"other words"` quotes. The number `3.14` below is technically a string because it is wrapped in quotes.
```js
"hello world ü•∞"
'3.14'
`strings wrapped
 using back ticks support
 multiple lines`
```

A later lesson will discuss types categorized as `Objects` (collections like `arrays`, `objects`, `Date`, etc.).
```js
[4,1,2]
{key: "value"}
new Date()
```

## Expressions

An [expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) is any unit of code that resolves to a data value. Expressions are the fundamental building blocks of code, and use data ("operands") with [operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp) to perform math, logic, or string calculations.



### üëâ **Try it out** - Explore data types using the Javascript Console

1. **Primary expressions** - If you pass data to Javascript it will simply **return** the data's value.

```js
12
```

2. Adding an [arithmetic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators) operator and another data value will prompt Javascript to **evaluate** the code, multiplying the values to **return** (*output*) the *new* value `144` produced.

```js
12 * 12
```

3. If you use the [`typeof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator, Javascript will return a string describing the data's *type*.

```js
typeof 12
```

4. The following [comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators) will return a logical `boolean` value based on whether the comparison in the expression is true.

```js
4 > 5
```

The [equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality) `==` checks to see if two values are equal, `true`

```js
1 == 1
```

The [inequality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Inequality) `!=` checks whether its two operands are *not equal*.

```js
1 != 1
```


The [strict equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) `===` will compare the value **and type**, and is specific to Javascript. **What will these return?**

```js
1 === "1"
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

It will return `false` because `1` is a `number` and `"1"` is a `string`.

</details>



If you combine expressions, Javascript will evaluate each in the appropriate order. **What will these return?**

```js
typeof (4 > 5)
typeof (typeof (4 > 5))
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
typeof (4 > 5) // -> "boolean"
typeof (typeof (4 > 5)) // -> "string"
```

`4 > 5` uses a comparison operator so it will return `false`. But since `typeof` returns a string, the first line will return `"boolean"` (note the double quotes), and the second line will return `"string"`

</details>










## Statements

A statement is any instruction to perform a specific action. I like to think of a statement as a sentence‚Äîthey even have punctuation (a semicolon `;`) at the end to tell Javascript the instruction is complete.

![true](../../assets/img/javascript-anatomy-statement.png)

The statement in the diagram uses an [assignment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators) to assign a value to variable, `greeting`, on the left. In the next section we will install Javascript and start using variables.










## Next steps

1. Review additional information in the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mTMY_jT3nVvrdE2JNrFNVsRBjnFFf90LhKB3W-2w3Fg/edit#slide=id.g3f99f37dc1_8_39) that accompany this section.
1. Try the [Exercises](#exercises) below.
1. Start working on homework listed in the schedule.
1. Continue to the [next lesson](../../README.md#javascript-part1).
