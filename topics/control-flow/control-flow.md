## Operators

Let's review some of the [operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp) we've seen thus far.



---

### [Arithmetic operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

Perform addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/` on numbers

```js
1 + 1 // -> 2
3.14 * 2 // -> 6.28
```

Increment `++` or decrement `--` a value

```js
let count = 1;
count ++; // -> 2
count --; // -> 1
```




---

### [Arithmetic operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

Modulus `%` to return the remainder from a division operation

```js
5 % 2 = 1
```

The `+` operator is also used to concatenate (add) strings

```js
"Hello" + " world!" // -> "Hello world!"
```



---

### [Assignment operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp)

Perform an expression and then assign the value.

```js
let apples = 100;
```

These operators can be used to add and assign number values ...

```js
apples ++; // -> 101
apples += 10; // -> 111
```

... or to (convert and) concatenate and assign strings.

```js
apples += " apples"; // -> "111 apples"
```



---

### [Comparison operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)

A double `==` compares values only then returns `true` or `false`. If operands of different types are used, Javascript will first convert to the type **on the left** and compare.

```js
1 == 1 // -> true
1 == "1" // -> true
1 != 2  // -> true
```

The triple `===` checks value and type

```js
1 === "1" // -> false
```

Greater than / greater than or equal to

```js
2 > 1 // -> true
3 <= 2 // -> false
```




---

## Conditions

Control flow determines which code is executed and the order in which it will happen. To illustrate this, first consider the default behavior of Javascript.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-control-structures-sequence.png" width="800">

As the program runs, it will execute the instructions it finds, line by line, until the end.

```js
let apples = 0;
apples = apples + 10;
console.log(`We have ${apples} apples!`);
```


---

## Conditions

However, this is not very interesting. Instead, you will want your code to perform *different* actions depending on the **state** of variables in your program. Use **conditionals** to do this.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-control-structures-if.png" width="800">

In the above diagram, an **`if`** statement is used to either run the statement block, or not, depending on whether the condition is true or false.



---

## Conditions


Here is the syntax for a basic `if` statement.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-anatomy-if-code-block.png" width="800">

In this case, if of `apples` is a number greater than 3, then the message will be logged to the console.


---

## Conditions

We can use an **`else`** to execute different code, if the first condition is not met.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-control-structures-if-else.png" width="800">


---

## Conditions


Here is `else` in practice:

```js
let apples = 2;
if (apples > 3) {
	console.log("we can make pie!")
} else {
	console.log("we need more apples")
}
```

---

## Conditions

We can use `if` `if/else` and `else` together like so:

```js
let apples = 2;
if (apples > 5) {
	console.log("we can make cider!")
} else if (apples > 3) {
	console.log("we can make pie!")
} else {
	console.log("we need more apples")
}
```



---

## Combining conditionals with logical operators

Finally, we can combine conditional statements with logical operators to account for more than one variable in a program. [Logical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp) are used to determine how to combine true and false values using logical and `&&`, or `||`, not `!`.


Use `&&` ("and") to test if ***both*** expressions are `true`

```js
(1 < 2 && 3 > 4) // -> false
```



---

## Combining conditionals with logical operators


Use `||` ("or") to test if ***either*** expression is `true`

```js
(1 < 2 || 3 > 4) // -> true
```

Use `!` ("not") to test if the expression is ***not*** `true`

```js
!true // -> false
!false // -> true
!(1 < 2) // -> false
```




---

## Combining conditionals with logical operators

And, putting it all together, evaluate more than one condition in an if, if else statement


```js
let apples = 2, // a comma separates multiple variable declarations
    blueberries = 4;

if (apples >= 2 && blueberries >= 4) {
	console.log("we can make fruit salad")
} else if (apples > 3 || blueberries > 2) {
	console.log("we can make pie!")
} else {
	console.log("we need more fruit")
}
```
