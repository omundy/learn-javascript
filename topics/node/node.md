## About Node

- Node.js is Javascript for the command line.
- With Node you can build servers, connect to databases, create APIs, full stack websites, standalone software, and much more.
- NPM (Node Package Manager) lets you install / manager open source software packages you can include in your projects.


---

## Node Installation

There are several ways to install Node (which includes NPM) on your machine (ordered easiest to hardest)

1. Use an [installer via node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (fastest, but difficult to upgrade).
1. Use a system package manager like Homebrew or Scoop (easy to upgrade)
1. Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (is the most flexible method but potentially adds complexity for new users).






---

## Install Node using Homebrew (Mac)

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac package manager) using their instructions
2. Install [Node](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)

```bash
brew install node
```


---

## Install Node & NPM using Scoop (Windows)

1. Install [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (Windows package manager) using their instructions
2. Install [Node](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=nodejs&s=0&d=1&o=true)

```bash
scoop install nodejs
```





---

## Confirm your Node version

```bash
node -v                    # check node version
npm -v                     # check npm version
```


---

## Install Nodemon

- Nodemon will automatically restart your node scripts when you save your file.

```bash
npm install -g nodemon     # install a package globally
nodemon index.js # run your node script, restarting for each save
```
