## About Node

- Node.js is Javascript for the command line.
- With Node you can build servers, connect to databases, create APIs, full stack websites, standalone software, and much more.
- NPM (Node Package Manager) lets you install / manager open source software packages you can include in your projects.


---

## Node Installation

There are several ways to install Node (which includes NPM) on your machine (starting with the easiest)

1. Use an [installer via node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (fastest, but difficult to upgrade).
1. Use a system package manager like Homebrew or Scoop (easy to upgrade)
1. Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (is the most flexible method but potentially adds complexity for new users).






---

## üëâ Install Node using Homebrew (Mac)

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac package manager) using their instructions
2. Install [Node](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)

```bash
brew install node
```


---

## üëâ Install Node & NPM using Scoop (Windows)

1. Install [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (Windows package manager) using their instructions
2. Install [Node](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=nodejs&s=0&d=1&o=true)

```bash
scoop install nodejs
```





---

## üëâ Confirm your Node version

Run these to make sure that Node installed correctly:

```bash
node -v                    # check node version
npm -v                     # check npm version
```



---

## üëâ Run a script with Node

Node is just Javascript, so almost any code will run.

1. Create a file on your computer named `index.js` and paste the below code.
2. Navigate to the folder on the command line
3. Run the code with `node index.js`

```js
let greeting = "Hello, from Node";
console.log(greeting);
```




---

## üëâ Install Nodemon

- Nodemon will automatically restart your node scripts when you save your file (so you don't have to every time).

```bash
npm install -g nodemon     # install a package globally
nodemon index.js # run your node script, restarting for each save
```

To exit from nodemon use `ctl+c`


---

## üëâ Basic Demo

Look inside the [basic-node](./basic-node) demo in this tutorial and read through and run the `index.js` file for more on node:

1. Hello, World
2. Creating a custom module
3. Writing to a file

## How to install Node using NVM

[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro) (NVM) make it easy to install and use different versions of node via the command line. [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28017374/what-is-the-suggested-way-to-install-brew-node-js-io-js-nvm-npm-on-os-x)

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Update then install NVM

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade
brew install nvm
```

See [these instructions for NVM, Node, NPM on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)
