## FAQ & Tips > What web browsers should I target?

There are many web browser brands, but most are based on just three [browser engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine) "types".

- [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)) (part of the [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) project) is used by [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome), [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)), [Brave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)), and [Microsoft Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge)
- [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)) used by [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)
- [Webkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) used by Safari (and [several others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#WebKit-based) including Google Chrome and Firefox for iOS)

## FAQ & Tips > Issues with CSS and browser extensions

CSS from web pages will affect ("pollute") display properties in your extension, often messing up your own styling. For example, if this rule is set on a page your extension then html that you show in the content scripts will inherit it:

```css
p { color: red; }
```

---

## FAQ & Tips > Issues with CSS and browser extensions

These tips help ensure your code won't inherit other styles (listed in increasing potential to protect your own):
- Use uncommon class and id names. This works unless the styling rules are applied very broadly (like above).
- Wrap all your code within a unique class or id.
- Use `!important` on all your rules.
- If all else fails, explicitly set a default for **every** property in your extension.

```css
#uniquePrefix p { color: black !important; }
```

## FAQ & Tips > Common Errors and Issues


#### Uncaught Error: Extension context invalidated.
The error, `Uncaught Error: Extension context invalidated`, can occur when you update an in-development extension and then interact with a web page without refreshing the page to get the newly updated extension. The issue is that the (now outdated) content scripts injected and running on the page have attempted to access an extension that no longer exists (since it was updated).
