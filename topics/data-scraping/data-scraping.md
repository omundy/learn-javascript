## Browser Extensions

- Browser extensions have access to everything all the data on a page. 
- A user would have to visit each page scraped, which can actually be a bonus if the information requires a login. 
- See topics/extensions for more

## Browser Testing Tools

- Using browser testing tools, one can instruct them to act a user to visit locally or remotely hosted websites, submit forms, and other actions in the browser.
- For example, the Nightwatch Javascript testing library can [automate browser activity](https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/overview/what-is-nightwatch.html) through [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
