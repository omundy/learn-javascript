## About

## Install Grunt

Install grunt globally so you can call it simply with `grunt`

```bash
# install grunt globally
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

---

## üëâ Run the test project


```bash
# cd into example
cd demos/grunt-test-project
# install packages
npm i 
# run
grunt watch
```

Now, every time you save a file inside the directory, including `Gruntfile.js`, Grunt will re-load the file on the terminal. 

Check out the Grunt config at the root of this repository.
