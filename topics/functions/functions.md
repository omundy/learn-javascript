## About Functions

- A function is a reusable block of instructions.
- Functions can receive values (**parameters**) to change their **return values**.

	Functions help to keep your code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">D.R.Y.</a>

## Function I/O

- Define a function with the `function` keyword, a unique name, two parentheses, and a statement block.
- The code inside the statement block (the curly braces `{ ... }` ) is executed when the function is **called**.

## Function Example

Look at the code from the previous lesson. This code runs once and that is all.

```js
let apples = 2;

if (apples > 3) {
	console.log(`We have ${apples} apples! We can make pie!`)
} else {
	console.log(`We have ${apples} apples! We need more apples`)
}
// -> "We have 2 apples! We need more fruit."
```


---

## Function Example

<div class="twocolumn">
<div class="col">

Wrapping the code with a function block lets us

1. Change the value that determines the logical flow
2. Run the code multiple times with different values

</div>
<div class="col">


```js
function pieChance(fruit, count){
    let str = `We have ${count} ${fruit}! `;
    if (count > 3) {
        str += `We can make pie!`;
    } else {
        str += `We need more fruit.`;
    }
    return str;
}

console.log(`${pieChance("apples", 2)}`);
// -> "We have 2 apples! We need more fruit."

console.log(`${pieChance("pears", 5)}`);
// -> "We have 5 pears! We can make pie!"

console.log(`${pieChance("berries", 101)}`);
// -> "We have 101 berries! We can make pie!"
```

</div>
</div>

There are a few things going on in here:

1. The conditional that formerly outputted a string is now inside a *reusable* function.
1. The variable that we evaluate in the function is **scoped** only to that function. We use an underscore before it to remember that. See functional programming for more.

## Another Example

```js

function isSandwich(str) {
	let result = true;

	if (str[0] != "ü•ñ" || str[0] != "üçû") result = false;
	if (str[str.length-1] != "ü•ñ" || str[str.length-1] != "üçû") result = false;


	if (str.match < 1 "ü•ì" && b == "ü•¨" && c == "üçÖ")  result = false;
	else if (a == "ü•ñ" && b == "üßÄ" && c == "ü•ñ")  result = false;
	else if (a == "ü•ñ" && b == "ü•ì" && c == "ü•ñ")  result = false;
	else if (a == "ü•ñ" && b == "ü•ì" && c == "üßÄ" && d == "ü•ñ")  result = false;
	else if (a == "üçî" || a == "üå≠")  result = false;
	return false;
}

```

## Another Example

```js
const isItTimeForPizza = () => {
    let today = new Date();
	if (today.getHours() > 10 && today.getHours() < 24){
		return "yes, it is";
	} else {
		return "I'm afraid not";
	}
}
console.log(isItTimeForPizza());
```




---

## Scope

All variables have scope‚Äîthe part of your program in which it can be accessed. There are two types:

- Global: A variable is accessible by the whole program
- Local: A variable is accessible only within its statement block

## Side Effects

- [**Side effects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)) are statements that evaluate an expression and produce some other effect instead of returning a value.

```js
alert(1 + 1); // -> Opens a popup window
console.log(1 < 2); // -> logs to the console
```
