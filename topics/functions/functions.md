# Functions & Scope

Reusing code, protecting variables, callback functions











Functions are the next step in creating control structures. Say we have the code from the previous lesson

```js
let apples = 2;
if (apples > 3) {
	console.log("we can make pie!")
} else {
	console.log("we need more apples")
}
apples = apples + 10;
console.log(`We have ${apples} apples!`);
```

What if we wanted to make it so a user could change the value stored in `apples` and then run the check again? This is where functions come in...

```js
let apples = 2;
console.log(`We have ${apples} apples!`);

function checkApples(_apples){
    if (_apples > 3) {
    	return "we can make pie!";
    } else {
    	return "we need more apples";
    }
}




apples = apples + 10;

```


There are a few things going on in here:

1. The conditional that formerly outputted a string is now inside a *reusable* function.
1. The variable that we evaluate in the function is **scoped** only to that function. We use an underscore before it to remember that. See functional programming for more.

    let today = new Date();
	if (today.getHours() > 10 && today.getHours() < 24){
		return "yes, it is";
	} else {
		return "I'm afraid not";

console.log(isItTimeForPizza());

### Side Effects

These are statements with **side effects**. Instead of returning a value, they evaluate the expression and then produce some other effect. The built-in `alert()` function opens a popup window to show the value that is returned from the expression.

```js
alert(1 + 1);
console.log(1 < 2);
```
