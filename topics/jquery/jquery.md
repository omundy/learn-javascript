## What is jquery

- jquery is a library that reduces the complexity of using Javascript with HTML.
- The goal is to "write less, do more" including:
    - Write to web pages to change content, elements, or styles - HTML/CSS/DOM manipulation
    - Listen for user and page events
    - Add effects like showing, hiding, or animating content
    - Can get external or remote data from API using AJAX (asynchronous Javascript)
    - Fix cross browser issues




## Installation

Like many frameworks, jquery can be installed with one line of code. You can [download](https://jquery.com/download/) the file to your project, [install it with NPM](https://jquery.com/download/#downloading-jquery-using-npm-or-yarn), or [link to a CDN](https://jquery.com/download/#using-jquery-with-a-cdn).

> CDNs can offer a performance benefit by hosting jQuery on servers spread across the globe. This also offers an advantage that if the visitor to your webpage has already downloaded a copy of jQuery from the same CDN, it won't have to be re-downloaded.

After you import the framework into the page and you can access jquery functions via $



```js
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
<script>
// now you can use jquery!

// select all divs, set backgrounds red
$('div').css({ 'background': 'red' });


</script>
```


## document.ready()

For the same reason you add Javascript after the page elements have loaded, you can only use jquery functions after you import the library.





## Selectors

## Selecting classes

These [samples](demos/1-dom-vanilla-vs-jquery.html) do the same thing, adding data to multiple elements on a page, yet the jquery version is much easier to write and less error prone.



Pure Javascript

```js
var ele = document.getElementsByClassName('myClass'); // array of elements
for (var i = 0; i < ele.length; ++i) {
	var item = ele[i];
	item.innerHTML += ' ++ new data (pure js)';
}
```

Javascript + jQuery

```js
$('.myClass').append(' ## new data (jquery)');
```
