## About

- This topic is about using Javascript to publish mobile (iOS, Android) and desktop (Mac, Windows) applications.
- There are a number of Javascript frameworks to publish native apps. IOW, you don't need to learn Java (Android) and Objective C (iOS) to make your apps cross-platform. 





## Hybrid vs. Native mobile apps

<div class="twocolumn1x2">
<div class="col">

**Hybrid mobile apps** combine your mobile website with a web view (browser) into a single application. When launched web view only displays your website and none of the usual aspects of the browser like the address bar. Examples include: PhoneGap, ionic, sencha touch, Osen Ui

</div>
<div class="col">

**Native mobile apps** use the OS's native components and do not depend on a web view. They have better performance and reliability compared to hybrid apps. 
- React Native [mobile](https://reactnative.dev/) or [desktop](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/)
- Tabris.js
- Native script

## About Electron

Electron is a JS framework for building [desktop](https://patrickhq.medium.com/react-native-vs-electron-js-what-is-better-for-cross-platform-app-development-9cf64ef399f9) applications

## About React Native

React Native is a JS library that uses React's declarative UI to render native components for Android and iOS.


1. Read about core components and react fundamentals in the [introduction](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
1. Follow their [quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=quickstart) to create a project and run the hello world

## Start with Expo

The easiest way to get started building and testing your app on a phone is [with Expo](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). 

```bash
# create new project and cd into it
npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject && cd AwesomeProject
# start expo app
npx expo start
```

Apps published with Expo require the [Expo SDK](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/) which provides decent (but abstracted) access to native APIs. There are also [a few other considerations](https://adhithiravi.medium.com/building-react-native-apps-expo-or-not-d49770d1f5b8).




---

## Cross-Platform Differences

- Much Expo/React Native code can be reused across platforms, but there are some differences.
- Native components look different because of design guidelines on each platform (see [Apple Human Interface](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/) and [Android Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/design))
- For example, the `<Button>` component is rendered differently on iOS and Android.
