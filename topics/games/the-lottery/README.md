# The Lottery (game)

A simple exercise to illustrate variables, conditionals, functions, event listeners, and html DOM manipulation using pure (a.k.a. "vanilla") Javascript.

## Instructions

Typically in application development, one builds a simple prototype to work out the core logic of their program. Then, each successive version builds on top of the original, adding features and polishing.

1. Try to code each version of The Lottery without viewing the Javascript source.
1. Start with the template [on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/ZEoyMGw?editors=1011) or [the file](the-lottery-v0.html)
1. We will build each next version in class.
