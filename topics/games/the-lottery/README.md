# The Lottery (game)

This exercise illustrates variables, conditionals, functions, event listeners, and html DOM manipulation using pure (a.k.a. "vanilla") Javascript.



## Instructions

> In application development, one typically builds a simple prototype to work out the core logic or proof of concept (POC) of their program. Then, each successive version builds on top of the original, adding features and polishing. â€”Owen Mundy

1. Start with the template [on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/ZEoyMGw?editors=1011) or [the file](the-lottery-v0.html)
1. Try to code each version of The Lottery without viewing the Javascript source.
1. You can look at the console, but not the source code.


## Versions

1. [Lottery v.1](https://omundy.github.io/learn-javascript/topics/games/the-lottery/the-lottery-v1.html)
	- Intro to [conditionals](../../control-flow/slides.html) and `Math.random()`
	- Use `console.log()` to display results in the console
1. [Lottery v.2](https://omundy.github.io/learn-javascript/topics/games/the-lottery/the-lottery-v2.html)
	- For user input, first [select the button](../../dom/slides.html) `var button = document.querySelector("button")`
	- Then add an event listener `button.addEventListener(function() { /* code */ }))`
	- You should be able to play the game with the button and see results in the console
1. [Lottery v.3](https://omundy.github.io/learn-javascript/topics/games/the-lottery/the-lottery-v3.html)
	- Update elements in the page via the [DOM](../../dom/slides.html) Javascript
	- Display all results within the HTML of the page
