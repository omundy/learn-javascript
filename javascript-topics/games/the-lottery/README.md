# The Lottery (game)

A simple game to illustrate variables, conditionals, functions, event listeners, and html DOM manipulation using pure (a.k.a. "vanilla") Javascript.


## Instructions

Try to recreate each version without viewing the Javascript source. Start with this [template](the-lottery-v0.html).

- [Lottery v.1 - Intro to conditionals](https://omundy.github.io/learn-javascript/javascript-topics/games/the-lottery/the-lottery-v1.html) - Use conditionals, `Math.random()`, and `console.log()` to display results ([solution](the-lottery-v1.html))
- [Lottery v.2 - Listen for user input](https://omundy.github.io/learn-javascript/javascript-topics/games/the-lottery/the-lottery-v2.html) - Play the game with the button, and `console.log()` to display results ([solution](the-lottery-v2.html))
- [Lottery v.3 - Change the DOM with Javascript](https://omundy.github.io/learn-javascript/javascript-topics/games/the-lottery/the-lottery-v3.html) - Display all results within the HTML of the page ([solution](the-lottery-v3.html))


As is typical for all application development, the game starts with a simple prototype to work out the core logic, and that each successive version builds on top of the original, adding features and polishing.
