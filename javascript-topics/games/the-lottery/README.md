# The Lottery (game)

A simple game to illustrate variables, conditionals, event listeners, and html manipulation.

Note that, as is typical for all application development, the game starts with a simple prototype to work out the core logic, and that each successive version builds on top of the original, adding features and polishing. 

- v.1 - Introduction to conditionals, uses `console.log()` to display results
- v.2 - Uses a click listener to play lottery with the button, uses `console.log()` to display results
- v.3 - Displays all results within the HTML of the page
