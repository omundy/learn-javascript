# Single Page Applications

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app. â€”[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
