# About this content

A linear progression through full stack Javascript, with tutorials, exercises, and examples to:

- Interact with the DOM, HTML, and CSS inside web browsers
- Use libraries like jQuery, Anime.js, etc.
- Run Javascript, Node.js, and NPM on the command line
- Build a dynamic Node/Express website and API server
- Create browser extensions, data visualization, games, desktop and mobile apps and other UIs with Javascript



## Why did I create this?

"There lots of Javascript books and resources online, why did I make this?"

- While there are some exceptions (Codecademy, which I use for homework) I have found most books and websites that teach Javascript too verbose. You could say the material in my project contains the highlights, or essentials, to get up and running with Javascript.
- The Javascript instruction is only part of what I teach. I pair this with other materials focused on computing, culture, and critical design & technology perspectives. Specifically, I teach Part.1 in DIG 245 Critical Web Design and Part.2 in DIG 345 Radical Software.
- I believe in hands-on, active learning. I often will have students work on this in pairs, where they gain the knowledge and *experience* running the examples, answering the prompts, etc.



## Structure

Each section or class period is structured following the [Hunter Lesson Plan](https://thesecondprinciple.com/teaching-essentials/models-of-teaching/madeline-hunter-lesson-plan-model/) with approximate time estimates:
```
- Homework (items to be completed prior to each class)
	- 1 hour: Read book chapters
	- 1 hour: Do Codecademy practice
	- 1 hour: Independent practice, exercises in book
	- 30 min: Review lecture from class, reference sheet, w3schools
- In class (the class period, online or f2f)
	- 20 min: Evaluation - Quiz on, and then review of, homework material
	- 20 min: Introduction to new material - Lecture and demo
	- 20-40 min: Guided practice - Exercises and start homework
```





## Other materials

Anyone is welcome to fork the repo and use this course structure. You will need the following books, prior experience with HTML and CSS, and (potentially) accounts with Github, Codecademy, and Codepen:

- Marijn Haverbeke [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) 3rd edition (2018) [github](https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript)
- Ethan Brown [Web Development with Node & Express](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/web-development-with/9781492053507/) 2nd Edition (2019) [github](https://github.com/EthanRBrown/web-development-with-node-and-express-2e)
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)




## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have basic knowledge of the following:

1. The command line
1. Git & Github
1. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) provides the structure for web pages
1. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the **presentation** of the HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>A simple web page</title>
		<style>
			h1 { background: magenta; }
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello world!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```



## Code formatting

Currently using [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) (and plugins: [normalize whitespace](https://prismjs.com/plugins/normalize-whitespace/)) thanks to [this article](https://www.taniarascia.com/adding-syntax-highlighting-to-code-snippets/)
