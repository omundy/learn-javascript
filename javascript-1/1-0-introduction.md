## What is Programming?

Programming is simply the act of ‚Äúwriting instructions for a computer to execute.‚Äù Programming usually involves:

- **Flow** - The order in which statements are executed.
- **State** - The status of data (variables) in your program.
- **Logic** - Making decisions based on conditions (state).
- **Events** - Things that happen, like user input, that may change the state.

## What is Javascript?

Javascript is the programming language of the web. With Javascript you can

- change HTML, CSS, or content of a web page
- respond to user events, animate or display content or media
- (using Node.js) run on a server, query to databases, publish mobile apps
- and much more.



## How to use Javascript

Javascript can run in multiple locations in your browser, as well as your computer (using Node).

You can add Javascript to a **web page** inside a `<script>` element.

```html
<script>
alert("hello world!");
</script>
```

or load it into your page from an external `.js` file.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script src="assets/js/main.js"></script>
```

```js
// main.js
alert("hello world!");
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Always add `<script>` tags at the end, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to be sure all the HTML elements have loaded and are ready to be used by your code.


üëâ **Try it out** - There are two other great places to test Javascript.

1. **In the Console** - Open DevTools and paste this into the console. You will see a simple HTML alert.

```js
alert("hello world!");
```

2. **Code playgrounds** like [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net) and [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) make it easy to quickly test and share Javascript in a "web environment" (you can also add HTML and CSS files). Here are some examples from class: [Random Article Generator](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/PomvjqW), [Javascript / jQuery Cat Image Swapper](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/OJRWQoY), [Choropleth map with Mapbox](https://jsfiddle.net/ow3n/sw6ek1wb/). Add the code above to one of these playgrounds to test it out.

## Data Types

All programming languages use data to manage their state. Data has both a **value** and a **type**. Below, the **`boolean`** *type* can only have one of two *values*: `true` or `false`.

```js
true
false
```

Javascript is a loosely-typed language. This means Javascript will infer the data type of variables so you don't have to. Javascript organizes data by primitive and non-primitive types:

![true](../assets/img/javascript-diagram-data-types.png)

The Javascript **`number`** type does not distinguish integer from float values.
```js
1
3.14
-491143422
```

The **`string`** type includes any character as its value, wrapped using a single `'words'` or double `"other words"` quotes. The number `3.14` below is technically a string because it is wrapped in quotes.
```js
"hello world ü•∞"
'3.14'
`strings wrapped
 using back ticks support
 multiple lines`
```

A later lesson will discuss types categorized as `Objects` (collections like `arrays`, `objects`, `Date`, etc.).
```js
[4,1,2]
{key: "value"}
new Date()
```






## Expressions

An [expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) is any unit of code that resolves to a value. Expressions are the fundamental building blocks of code, and use [operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp) to perform assignments, math, logic, or string calculations.



üëâ **Try it out** - Read about and test the following expressions in the Console.

1. **Primary expressions** - If you pass data to Javascript it will simply **return** the data's value.

```js
12
```

2. However, if you use an [arithmetic operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators), Javascript will **evaluate** the code, multiplying the values to return a new value: `144`.

```js
12 * 12
```

3. If you use the [`typeof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator, Javascript will return a string describing the data's *type*.

```js
typeof 12
```

4. The following [comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators) will return a logical `boolean` value based on whether the comparison in the expression is true.

```js
4 > 5
```

The [equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality) `==` checks to see if two values are equal, `true`

```js
1 == 1
```

The [inequality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Inequality) `!=` checks whether its two operands are *not equal*.

```js
1 != 1
```


The [strict equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) `===` will compare the value **and type**, and is specific to Javascript. **What will these return?**

```js
1 === "1"
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

A: It will return `false` because `1` is a `number` and `"1"` is a `string`.

</details>



If you combine expressions, Javascript will evaluate each in the appropriate order. **What will these return?**

```js
typeof (4 > 5)
typeof (typeof (4 > 5))
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

`4 > 5` uses a comparison operator so it will return `false`. But since `typeof` returns a string, the first line will return `"boolean"` (note the double quotes), and the second line will return `"string"`

</details>










## Statements

A statement is any instruction to perform a specific action. I like to think of a statement as a sentence‚Äîthey even have punctuation (a semicolon `;`) at the end to tell Javascript the instruction is complete. The statement in the diagram uses an [assignment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators) to assign a value to variable, `greeting`, on the left.

![true](../assets/img/javascript-anatomy-statement.png)


These are statements with **side effects**. Instead of returning a value, they evaluate the expression and then produce some other effect. The built-in `alert()` function opens a popup window to show the value that is returned from the expression.

```js
alert(1 + 1);
console.log(1 < 2);
```














## Next steps

1. Review additional information in the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mTMY_jT3nVvrdE2JNrFNVsRBjnFFf90LhKB3W-2w3Fg/edit#slide=id.g3f99f37dc1_8_39) that accompany this section.
1. Try example expressions in the [Exercise](#exercise) below.
1. Continue learning about [Javascript variables](1-1-variables.md) in the next lesson.
