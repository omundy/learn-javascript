Reusing code, protecting variables, callback functions
























### Side Effects

These are statements with **side effects**. Instead of returning a value, they evaluate the expression and then produce some other effect. The built-in `alert()` function opens a popup window to show the value that is returned from the expression.

```js
alert(1 + 1);
console.log(1 < 2);
```
