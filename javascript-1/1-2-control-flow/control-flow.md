## Operators

Let's review some of the [operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp) we've seen thus far.


### [Arithmetic operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

Perform addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/` on numbers

```js
1 + 1 // -> 2
3.14 * 2 // -> 6.28
```

Increment `++` or decrement `--` a value

```js
let count = 1;
count ++; // -> 2
count --; // -> 1
```

Modulus `%` to return the remainder from a division operation

```js
5 % 2 = 1
```

The `+` operator can also be used to concatenate (add) strings

```js
"Hello" + " world!" // -> "Hello world!"
```



### [Assignment operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp)

Perform an expression and then assign the value.

```js
let apples = 100;
```

These operators can be used to add and assign number values ...

```js
apples ++; // -> 101
apples += 10; // -> 111
```

... or to (convert and) concatenate and assign strings.

```js
apples += " apples"; // -> "111 apples"
```



### [Comparison operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)

These operators are used to test for `true` or `false`.

The double `==` compares value only. If operands of different types are used then Javascript will convert to the type on the left and compare.

```js
1 == 1 // -> true
1 == "1" // -> true
1 != 2  // -> true
```

The triple `===` checks value and type

```js
1 === "1" // -> false
```

Greater than / greater than or equal to

```js
2 > 1 // -> true
3 <= 2 // -> false
```





### [Logical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)

Used to determine the logic between variables or values


Use `&&` ("and") to test if *both* expressions are `true`

```js
(1 < 2 && 3 > 4) // -> false
```

Use `||` ("or") to test if *either* expression is `true`

```js
(1 < 2 || 3 > 4) // -> true
```

Use `!` ("not") to test if the expression is not `true`

```js
!true // -> false
!false // -> true
!(1 < 2) // -> false
```




## Conditions

Control flow determines what code is executed and the order in which it will happen. To illustrate this, first consider the default behavior of Javascript.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-control-structures-sequence.png" width="800">

As the program runs, it will execute the instructions it finds, line by line, until the end.

```js
let apples = 0;
apples = apples + 10;
console.log(`We have ${apples} apples!`);
```

However, this is not very interesting. Instead, you will often want your code to perform *different* actions depending on the **state** of variables in your program.

You can use **conditionals** to do this.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-control-structures-if.png" width="800">

In the above diagram, an **`if`** statement is used to either run the statement block, or not, depending on whether the condition is true or false.

Here is the syntax for a basic `if` statement. In this case, if the value stored in `apples` is a number greater than 3, then the message will be logged to the console.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-anatomy-if-code-block.png" width="800">


We use an **`if/else`** to execute different code, if the first condition is not met.

<img src="../../assets/img/javascript-diagram-control-structures-if-else.png" width="800">

Here is the apples example in practice:

```js
let apples = 2;
if (apples > 3) {
	console.log("we can make pie!")
} else {
	console.log("we need more apples")
}
```
