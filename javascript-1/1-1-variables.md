## Syntax

Whitespace in your code can help make it readable. These examples will be executed the same.

```js
// without whitespace
if (true) { console.log("👍"); }
// with whitespace
if (true)
{
    console.log("👍");
}
```


## Comments and Whitespace

Comments can be used to add notes about code. They are preceded by `//` or enclosed by `/* ... */` and are not evaluated when the program runs.


```js
// a single line comment
/* a multiline
comment */
```







<!-- You can convert the type using Number('3.14') -->
