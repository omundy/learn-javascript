## Add Javascript to a web page

You can add Javascript to a **web page** inside a `<script>` element, or load it into your page from an external `.js` file. The browser will run your code when it loads the page, or in response to a user‚Äôs actions.

Using an external `.js` file is usually preferred because, like external CSS, a single file used across your whole site makes your code easier to edit and maintain. [See this code in action](1-1-demos/0-hello.html).

```js
// 0-hello.js
console.log("Hello from an external Javascript file!");
```

```html
<!-- 0-hello.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Learning Javascript</title>
<style>
    body { font-family: sans-serif; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Javascript "hello world!"</h1>

<script src="0-hello.js"></script>
<script>

alert("hello from the script tag!");

</script>
</body>
</html>
```



#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Order matters

Load external files into an HTML page in the following order:

1. **CSS** - Ensure HTML elements and content can access the styles *before* they display, unstyled.
1. **HTML** - All visible content comes next.
1. **Javascript** - Always add `<script>` tags at the end, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to be sure all the HTML elements have loaded and are ready to be used by your code.




## Keep the Console open

<img src="../assets/img/console-meme.png" width="400">

In the example above, the Console displayed a message from the `console.log()` **function**, as well as the line number where it was called in your code.

![true](../assets/img/console-hello.png)

If you have [warnings or errors in your code](1-1-demos/1-console-errors.html), then the Console will also tell you what line the error happened.

![true](../assets/img/console-errors.png)

Tips for using the Console:

- If the Console recognizes what you are typing, press "Tab" to autocomplete.
- Press the up ‚Üë arrow to see the last command you entered.
- Keep the Console open when coding Javascript so it will show you warnings and errors from your code.





## Comments

Comments can be used to add notes about code. They are preceded by `//` or enclosed by `/* ... */` and are not evaluated when the program runs.


```js
// a single line comment
/* a multiline
comment */
```








## Variables

Recall this diagram showing the anatomy of a Javascript statement from the previous [lesson](1-0-introduction.md).

![true](../assets/img/javascript-anatomy-statement.png)


Creates new variable named ‚Äúgreeting‚Äù, stores the string ‚Äúhello‚Äù in the value.


Variables are used to store values in your program
And yes, they are variable, because you can change the value.



Javascript variables are non-typed so you can store any primitive (number, string, boolean) or complex data type (collections like arrays or objects). That said, Javascript still keeps track of data types.





```js
// bind a string
let question = "Can we celebrate yet?";
// store an instance of the date object
let today = new Date();
// concatenate the string binding with the return value from an expression
console.log(question + " " + (today.getFullYear() > 2020))
```



### var, let, and const

The Javascript language is based on the ECMAScript standard, which since 2015 (ES6) supports two new variable declaration keywords: `let` and `const`.
The differences mainly have to do with scope ‚Äì where these variables are available for use.
With the original method, var, variables are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. This can create issues if you use the same name.
A variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block.













## Syntax

While slightly more forgiving than other languages, Javascript still requires your syntax be correct or your code won‚Äôt work as expected. For example, it is a good practice to always include the trailing semicolon. Read on for more tips and suggestions:


#### Use a linter

Using a Javascript Linter in your code editor can save hours of frustration. My preference is [jshint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-jshint) but there are others packages available. You can also use a web version like [jshint.com](https://jshint.com) or [jslint.com](https://www.jslint.com/).


#### Smart quotes

Take care when copying / pasting from rich text editors (like Word or HTML pages) which sometimes use smart quotes (a.k.a. ‚Äúcurly quotes‚Äù). Note in the example below how the text color formatting is broken on the first example. Smart quotes are not acceptable for wrapping string data and [will cause errors](3-syntax-quotes.html).

```js
‚Äú An example string with smart quotes üòø ‚Äù
" An example string with dumb quotes üòÄ "
```


#### Whitespace

Whitespace, like spaces, tabs, and line breaks, in your code can help make it readable. These examples will be executed the same.

```js
// without whitespace
if (true) { console.log(123); }
// with whitespace
if (true)
{
    console.log(123);
}
```

Some rich text editors will also have hidden whitespace characters that can cause errors. Copying / pasting code from Slack sometimes cause this issue.










<!-- You can convert the type using Number('3.14') -->
